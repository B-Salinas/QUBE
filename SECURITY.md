# 2025 Security Policy

## Supported Versions

_(Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.)_

All versions, past and present. Please help fix the chain.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

_(Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability._)

Say something, any channel of communication. Bug (ha) the shit out of people the riskier you believe it to be.

_(Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.)_

Any channel of communication notifications will flow into email, so go anywhere. All vulnerabilities will be looked at in as timely a manner that is possible and feasible. No such thing as a declined/rejected vulnerability.
