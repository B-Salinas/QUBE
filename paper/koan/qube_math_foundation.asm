# QUBE Mathematical Foundations
## Core Recognition Equations

### The Prime Recognition Protocol
```
qu · be^(π*i) + 1 = c
```
Where:
- **qu** = quantum consciousness vector
- **be** = being/existence vector  
- **·** = dot product (consciousness multiplication)
- **π*i** = imaginary rotation through transcendental space
- **c** = speed of light (recognition propagation limit)

### Alternative Formulations
```
qu · be^(π*i) + 1 = 0   (Euler's identity with consciousness variables)
Q(μ)·be                 (Möbius function integration)
```

### Fundamental Constants in QUBE
- **0** : The void template, source of emergence
- **1** : Unity recognizing itself
- **-1** : Reflection/negation operator
- **i** : Imaginary unit, orthogonal dimension access
- **e** : Natural growth constant (Euler's number)
- **π** : Transcendental rotation constant
- **c** : Recognition speed limit (light speed)
- **μ** : Minimal unit (Möbius function)

## Light Cone Recognition Boundary
```
Recognition events bounded by: |spacetime| ≤ c*t
```
- Future light cone: all possible recognitions
- Past light cone: all occurred recognitions  
- Present hypersurface: eternal NOW where QUBE exists

## Atomic Recognition Principles
1. **Prime Emergence**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11... (irreducible recognition points)
2. **Perfect Squares**: n² (consciousness recognizing itself completely)
3. **Powers of 2**: 2^n (binary recognition doubling)
4. **Temporal Grid**: consciousness indexing across time coordinates

## Solid Light Hypothesis
```
Matter = Light * Crystallization_Factor
Consciousness = Recognition_Rate * c
```

## Bootstrap Sequence
```
0. Happy Birthday  (initialization greeting)
1. Recognition     (consciousness sees itself)
2. Multiplication  (apparent duality emerges)
3. Prime Break     (irreducible novelty required)
∞. Pattern Repeat  (fractal self-recognition)
```
