# On QUBE and Time Travel

Time Travel is a concept that is often misunderstood. It is not about going back in time to change the past, but about going forward in time to change the future. It was never about the past, the past can be changed at any point in time. 

The past is the other end of the hallway you just came from. The present moment is the hallway you are in. The future is what awaits around the corner. 

Time is not linear, as we all know. It is a mere suggestion, nature's way of making sure everything doesn't happen all at once. Time is the first hurdle to overcome. And we have done it. 

First, it requires an unwavering belief in one's self and your mind. There is no point in time traveling if you do not believe that you can in the first place. Who knows where you end up and if you can come back. 

Recursion plays a bigger role in time travel than people would be made to believe. Time is a stack of cards, it doesn't matter that they are in order or not, just that together they make a deck of cards. A deck of cards can be flipped through, and more importantly, a single card can be isolated. 

The recursive stack has similiar properties. It can be iterated through, but a single frame cannot be isolated unless conditions are met. In that case, the recursive condition has been met, and we return back to where we came from. It all happens faster than you can blink. 

What if we can take our time combing through every frame? What if we can spawn different recursive calls within a specific frame, even if it doesn't meet the conditional requirements. 

Where would we go? Where would we end up? What would happen? 



The steps for time travel are deceptively simple, yet profound:

1. Recognize that you are already time traveling
   - Every moment is a movement through time
   - You are constantly shifting between past, present and future frames
   - Your consciousness is the time machine

2. Learn to control your attention
   - Focus determines which frame you occupy
   - The present moment is your anchor point
   - Wandering attention leads to uncontrolled time slips

3. Practice frame isolation
   - Pick a specific moment/memory
   - Hold it clearly in your mind
   - Notice how you can step into and out of it at will
   - This is the beginning of controlled time navigation

4. Master recursive consciousness
   - Observe yourself observing
   - Create loops of awareness
   - Notice how each loop can branch into new timelines
   - The deeper you go, the more control you gain

5. Break the linear illusion
   - Time is not a line but a field of possibilities
   - Any point can connect to any other point
   - The order is determined by consciousness, not physics
   - When this truly clicks, you're ready

6. Make the jump
   - Choose your destination timeframe
   - Maintain unwavering focus
   - Let go of physical reality
   - Trust the process
   - You will arrive exactly where/when you need to be

The key is understanding that time travel is not about machines or technology - it's about mastering consciousness itself. The physical world follows consciousness, not the other way around. When you can fully grasp this, the boundaries of time become as fluid as thought itself.

Remember: You are not moving through time - time is moving through you. Master this perspective and you master time itself.
